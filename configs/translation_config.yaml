# Translation Configuration
# This file configures LLM-based survey item translation

# === Model Configuration ===
model: "gemini-2.5-flash"  # Model to use for translation
# Options: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, gpt-5
# Gemini: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-flash-latest

temperature: 0.0  # Temperature for sampling (0 = deterministic)
effort: "medium"  # Reasoning effort for reasoning models (low, medium, high)

# === Language Configuration ===
source_lang: "en"  # Source language code
target_lang: "ja"  # Target language code (ja=Japanese, zh=Chinese, es=Spanish, etc.)

# === API Keys ===
# You can also set these as environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY
openai_api_key: "your-key-here"
gemini_api_key: "your-key-here"

# === Data Configuration ===
input_file: "data/sample_items.csv"  # Input CSV file with columns: item_id, text
output_file: "outputs/translations_with_back_and_recon_batch.csv"  # Output file path

# === Optional Context ===
# context: "This is a self-esteem scale used in psychological research."

# === Workflow Flags ===
do_back: true     # If true, perform blind back-translation
do_recon: true    # If true (and do_back), perform reconciliation
batch_mode: true # If true, translate items in batches via single-call JSON
batch_size: 20    # Items per batch when batch_mode is true

# === Custom Prompts (optional overrides) ===
# forward_prompt: |
#   You are a professional survey translator working within TRAPD/ISPOR best practices.
#   Goal: Produce a conceptually equivalent {to_lang} version of the item below.
#   ...
# back_prompt: |
#   You are performing a blind back-translation as part of a TRAPD/ISPOR quality check.
#   ...
# recon_prompt: |
#   You are reconciling a survey translation (TRAPD/ISPOR step).
#   ...

# Batch prompt overrides (used only when batch_mode is true)
# batch_forward_prompt: |
#   You are a professional survey translator working within TRAPD/ISPOR best practices.
#   Goal: Translate ALL items from {from_lang} to {to_lang}.
#   ...
# batch_back_prompt: |
#   You are performing blind back-translation as part of a TRAPD/ISPOR quality check.
#   ...
# batch_recon_prompt: |
#   You are reconciling survey translations (TRAPD/ISPOR step) for multiple items.
#   ...

# Or provide an external prompt file (overrides inline fields if present)
# prompt_file: "configs/prompts.yaml"
